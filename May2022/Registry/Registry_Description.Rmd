The three steps include:

1. Data processing: investigation and reporting  
    + Evaluate the data received from the registries  
    + Understand the the variables, their values, distributions, and identify potential problems  
    + From this report we can propose potential solutions on how to handle missing or unknown data, alternative values, or duplicated or problematic records  
2. Data cleaning  
    + Implement solutions for data cleaning given decisions from step 1 report  
    + Keep data in detailed format 
    + Create composite variables  
3. Data creation  
    + Output data to an "analysis ready" R data set  
    + Output data to a file that facilitates input into SAS
