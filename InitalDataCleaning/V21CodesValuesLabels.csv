3856,Heritable Trait,"Heritable trait pertains to evidence that a tumor is associated with a heritable mutation. In retinoblastoma, the heritable trait is a germline mutation in the RB1 gene, which is associated with bilateral disease, family history of retinoblastoma, presence of concomitant CNS midline embryonic tumor (commonly in pineal region), or retinoblastoma with an intracranial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (i.e., trilateral retinoblastoma). Children with any of these features may be assigned the H1 status without molecular testing.  High quality molecular testing for RB1 mutation is required to determine the presence or absence of RB1 mutation for children without clinical features of a heritable mutation.",7,"Test ordered, results not in chart"
