# BIRTHPLACE
http://datadictionary.naaccr.org/default.aspx?c=10&Version=18#250  
Description
Code for place of birth of the patient. If a patient has multiple tumors, all records should contain the same code.  
Rationale  
Place of Birth is helpful for patient matching and can be used when reviewing race and ethnicity. In addition, adding birthplace data to race and ethnicity allows for a more specific definition of the population being reported. Careful descriptions of ancestry, birthplace, and immigration history of populations studied are needed to make the basis for classification into ethnic groups clear. Birthplace has been associated with variation in genetic, socioeconomic, cultural, and nutritional characteristics that affect patterns of disease. A better understanding of the differences within racial and ethnic categories also can help states develop effective, culturally sensitive public health prevention programs to decrease the prevalence of high-risk behaviors and increase the use of preventive services.  
Note: For cases diagnosed January 1, 2013, and later, Birthplace--State [252] and Birthplace--Country [254] replace Birthplace [250].  
Codes  
See Appendix B  for numeric and alphabetic lists of places and codes (also see Appendix B of the SEER Program Code Manual at seer.cancer.gov/tools/codingmanuals/index.html).
```{r birthplace }

if("birthplace" %in% varName.list) { 
  birthplace <- as.factor(trimws(d[,"birthplace"]))
  # recode for interpretable birthplace
  #new.d.n <- data.frame(new.d.n, birthplace) # keep NAACCR coding
  new.d <- data.frame(new.d, birthplace)
  new.d <- apply_labels(new.d, birthplace = "Place of birth")
  
  cro(new.d$birthplace)
  #cro(new.d$registryid, new.d$birthplace)
  
  }

```

# BIRTHPLACE--STATE
USPS abbreviation for the state, commonwealth, U.S. possession; or CanadaPost abbreviation for the Canadian province/territory in which the patient was born. If the patient has multiple primaries, the state of birth is the same for each tumor. This data item became part of the NAACCR transmission record effective with Volume II, Version 13 in order to include country and state for each geographic item and to use interoperable codes. It supplements the item BIRTHPLACE--COUNTRY [254]. These two data items are intended to replace the item BIRTHPLACE [250].  
Rationale  
This is a modification of the current item Birthplace [250] item in order to make use of standard codes, rather than using geographic codes that are only used by cancer registries. The intention is that item 250 be converted to populate the new corresponding, more standard, data items.
Codes  
See Appendix B for numeric and alphabetic lists of places and codes (also see Appendix B of the SEER Program Code Manual at seer.cancer.gov/tools/codingmanuals/index.html).
```{r birthplace state }

if("birthplacestate" %in% varName.list) {
  birthplacestate <- as.factor(trimws(d[,"birthplacestate"]))
  # recode for interpretable birthplace stat
  #new.d.n <- data.frame(new.d.n, birthplacestate) # keep NAACCR coding
  new.d <- data.frame(new.d, birthplacestate)
  new.d <- apply_labels(new.d, birthplacestate = "State of birth")
  
  cro(new.d$birthplacestate)
  #cro(new.d$registryid, new.d$birthplacestate)
  
  }

```

# BIRTHPLACE--COUNTRY
Code for the country in which the patient was born. If the patient has multiple tumors, all records should contain the same code. This data item became part of the NAACCR transmission record effective with Volume II, Version 13 in order to include country and state for each geographic item and to use interoperable codes. It supplements the item BIRTHPLACE--STATE [252]. These two data items are intended to replace the use of BIRTHPLACE [250].  
Rationale  
Place of Birth is helpful for patient matching and can be used when reviewing race and ethnicity. It is an important item in algorithms for imputing race and ethnicity. In addition, adding birthplace data to race and ethnicity allows for a more specific definition of the population being reported. Careful descriptions of ancestry, birthplace, and immigration history of populations studied are needed to make the basis for classification into ethnic groups clear. Birthplace has been associated with variation in genetic, socioeconomic, cultural, and nutritional characteristics that affect patterns of disease. A better understanding of the differences within racial and ethnic categories also can help states develop effective, culturally-sensitive public health prevention programs to decrease the prevalence of high-risk behaviors and increase the use of preventive services.

# DATE OF DIAGNOSIS
Date of initial diagnosis by a recognized medical practitioner for the tumor being reported whether clinically or microscopically confirmed. See Chapter X for date format.
```{r data of diagnosis }
if("dateofdiagnosis" %in% varName.list) {
  dateofdiagnosis <- trimws(d[,"dateofdiagnosis"])

  summary(new.d$dateofdiagnosis)
  #by(new.d$dateofdiagnosis, new.d$registryid, summary)
}


```

# PRIMARY SITE
Code for the primary site of the tumor being reported using either ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3. NAACCR adopted ICD-O-2 as the standard coding system for tumors diagnosed beginning January 1, 1992. In addition, NAACCR recommended that tumors diagnosed prior to 1992 be converted to ICD-O-2. The topography (primary site) codes did not change between ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3.
```{r primary site of tumor }
if("primarysite" %in% varName.list) {
  primarysite <- as.factor(d[,"primarysite"])
  levels(primarysite) <- list(Prostate="C619") # other codings become NA
  new.d <- data.frame(new.d, primarysite)
  new.d <- apply_labels(new.d, primarysite = "Primary Tumor Site")
  
  cro(new.d$primarysite)# this is pretty but doesn't show NAs
  summary(new.d$primarysite)
}

```

# GRADE
Code for the grade or degree of differentiation of the reportable tumor. For lymphomas and leukemias, field also is used to indicate T-, B-, Null-, or NK-cell origin.  
See the grade tables on page 67 of ICD-O-3.16 See also the most recent CoC STORE manual and SEER Program Code Manual, for site specific coding rules and conversions.

1	Grade I  
2	Grade II  
3	Grade III  
4	Grade IV  
5	T-cell  
6	B-cell  
7	Null cell  
8	NK (natural killer) cell  
9	Grade/differentiation unknown, not stated, or not applicable  
Comment: Use the most recent Hematopoietic and Lymphoid rules for assigning grades 5-8.  
```{r grade }
if("grade" %in% varName.list) {
  grade <- as.factor(d[,"grade"])
  levels(grade) <- list(Grade_I="1",
                        Grade_II="2",
                        Grade_III="3",
                        Grade_IV="4",

# TYPE OF REPORTING SOURCE
This variable codes the source documents used to abstract the majority of information on the tumor being reported. This may not be the source of original case finding (for example, if a case is identified through a pathology laboratory report review and all source documents used to abstract the case are from the physician’s office, code this item 4).  

Rationale
The code in this field can be used to explain why information may be incomplete on a tumor. For example, death certificate only cases have unknown values for many data items, so one may want to exclude them from some analyses. The field also is used to monitor the success of non-hospital case reporting and follow-back mechanisms. All population-based registries should have some death certificate-only cases where no hospital admission was involved, but too high a percentage can imply both shortcomings in case-finding and that follow-back to uncover missed hospital reports was not complete.

Coding Instructions
Code in the following priority order: 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7. This is a change to reflect the addition of codes 2 and 8 and to prioritize laboratory reports over nursing home reports. The source facilities included in the previous code 1 (hospital inpatient and outpatient) are split between codes 1, 2, and 8.

This data item is intended to indicate the completeness of information available to the abstractor. Reports from health plans (e.g., Kaiser, Veterans Administration, military facilities) in which all diagnostic and treatment information is maintained centrally and is available to the abstractor are expected to be at least as complete as reports for hospital inpatients, which is why these sources are grouped with inpatients and given the code with the highest priority.

Sources coded with '2' usually have complete information on the cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment.

Sources coded with '8' would include, but would not be limited to, outpatient surgery and nuclear medicine services. A physician's office that calls itself a surgery center should be coded as a physician's office. Surgery centers are equipped and staffed to perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia. If a physician's office calls itself a surgery center, but cannot perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia, code as a physician office.

Codes
1	Hospital inpatient; Managed health plans with comprehensive, unified medical records
2	Radiation Treatment Centers or Medical Oncology Centers (hospital-affiliated or independent)
3	Laboratory only (hospital-affiliated or independent)
4	Physician's office/private medical practitioner (LMD)
5	Nursing/convalescent home/hospice
6	Autopsy only
7	Death certificate only
8	Other hospital outpatient units/surgery centers
```{r type of reporting source}
if("typeofreportingsource" %in% varName.list) {
  typeofreportingsource <- as.factor(d[,"typeofreportingsource"])

# DERIVED SUMMARY STAGE 2018
Description  
Derived Summary Stage 2018 is derived using the EOD data collection system (EOD Primary Tumor [772], EOD Regional Nodes [774] and EOD Mets [776]) algorithm. Other data items may be included in the derivation process. Effective for cases diagnosed 1/1/2018+.

Rationale  
The SEER program has collected staging information on cases since its inception in 1973. Summary Stage groups cases into broad categories of in situ, local, regional, and distant. Summary Stage can be used to evaluate disease spread at diagnosis, treatment patterns and outcomes over time.
 
Derived Summary Stage 2018 [762] is only available at the central registry level.
Note: This data item was included in Standards Volume II, Version 16; however, it was not implemented until 2018.

Codes  
0	In situ  
1	Localized  
2	Regional, direct extension only  
3	Regional, regional lymph nodes only  
4	Regional, direct extension and regional lymph nodes  
7	Distant  
8	Benign, borderline  
9	Unknown if extension or metastasis (unstaged, unknown, or unspecified)  
Death certificate only case
